# 5.0.0 (2022-10-15)

### Features

- deny class methods on [@private](https://github.com/private) classes
  [#238](https://github.com/proofit404/generics/issues/238) 2be2561

### BREAKING CHANGES

- It is used to instantiate classes. We use `dependencies` library and stories
  state normalization for such things. I would like not to work on same thing
  twice. In addition I personally would never use factory method pattern. The
  worst part, it broke `@delegated` decorator semantic since it planned to be
  used with instances only. Class methods on delegated classes does not make
  sense.

  we suggest to use `typing.Protocol` instead.
