In our opinion, main benefits of having objects implemented in the language are
encapsulation and polymorphous. Classes that could be easily used in a
composition are tricky to write. The `generics` library aims to help you in
writing code with high quality.

## Pros

- Real private attributes without loosing the readability
- Leads to a better design forcing you to use encapsulation properly
- Makes writing quality code with high cohesion and low coupling easier
- Guides you to follow SOLID principles

## Example

The `generics` library gives you an easy way to define private attributes on
objects without loosing little nice things like readability.

```pycon

>>> from generics import private

>>> @private
... class User:
...     def __init__(self, name):
...         self.name = name
...
...     def greet(self):
...         return f"Hello, {self.name}"

>>> user = User("Jeff")

>>> user.greet()
'Hello, Jeff'

>>> hasattr(user, "name")
False

```
